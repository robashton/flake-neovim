# My Neovim setup


This is likely of no interest to anybody, and simply exists as its own repo so I can get my own vim from anywhere in the world with

```
nix run github:robashton/flake-neovim
```

Now that said, it has some potential value as something to start off from because unlike the existing neovim flakes out here, it doesn't bother trying to do anything to make anything optional and as a result if you were to replace my dot files with your own, and replace the list of plugins with your own, you would end up with your own vim in a flake.

My own config isn't elaborate, but it is bound to my muscle memory so having access to it easily is quite a game changer.
